<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p></p>
The Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the TenderTree website and services ("Site") provided by TenderTree, Inc. ("TenderTree"). Please read these Terms before using or continuing to use the Site. Do not agree to the Terms unless you both fully understand and accept each one. By using or continuing to use the Site, you represent and warrant that you understand, agree to, and accept all terms and conditions contained in this document.
Services
<p></p>
TenderTree provides this website to you, the "Client" or the "Contractor", and to any other entity on whose behalf you accept these Terms (collectively "you"). These Terms are entered into by and between TenderTree and you, and you accept them by: (a) transacting caregivering sessions through the Site; (b) using the Site in any other manner; and/or (c) acknowledging agreement with these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Site.
<p></p>
TenderTree controls and operates the Site from various locations and makes no representation that this website is appropriate or available for use in all locations. TenderTree services may not be available in your location, and available services may vary among locations. In addition, TenderTree will attempt to deliver all correspondence sent via the Site's messaging system. TenderTree cannot, however, guarantee delivery of all messages.
<p></p>
The site lists caregivers who are willing to be engaged by you as independent contractors. As independent contractors, the listed caregivers control the methods, materials and all aspects of the lessons. You are responsible for selecting the right caregiver for your needs. In making your hiring decision, you should review and investigate each caregiver's self-reported credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from other clients. All caregiving sessions should be supervised by a responsible adult.
<h2>Your Obligations and Conduct</h2>
<p></p>
In consideration of your use of the Site, you agree to: (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information about you as may be prompted by a registration form on the website ("Registration Data"); (b) maintain the security of your password and identification; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data and any information you provide to TenderTree, to keep it accurate, current and complete; (d) accept all risks of unauthorized access to information and Registration Data; and (e) avoid using the Site if you are under the age of 18. If you are are under the age of 18, you are not allowed to register on the Site and you must ask a parent or guardian to register on your behalf.
<p></p>
You are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, or otherwise transmit through your use of the Site ("Content"). You agree not to upload, post or otherwise transmit Content that: (a) is inaccurate, harmful, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, racist, violent, offensive, harassing, or otherwise objectionable to TenderTree or other users of the website; (b) includes unauthorized disclosure of personal information; (c) violates or infringes anyone's intellectual property rights; or (d) contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment. TenderTree reserves the right to edit or remove Content that violates these Terms or that contains third-party commercial advertisements.
<h2>Confidentiality of TenderTree Information</h2>
<p></p>
You may obtain direct access via the Site to certain confidential information of TenderTree and its affiliates, including without limitation technical, contractual, product, program, pricing, marketing and other valuable information that should reasonably be understood as confidential ("Confidential Information"). You must hold Confidential Information in strict confidence. Title to Confidential Information remains with TenderTree and its affiliates.
<p></p>
The Terms impose no obligation upon you with respect to Confidential Information that you can establish by legally sufficient evidence: (a) you possessed prior to your receipt from TenderTree, without an obligation to maintain its confidentiality; (b) is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission by you, or otherwise without violation of the Terms; (c) you obtained from a third party who had the right to disclose it, without an obligation to keep such information confidential; (d) You independently developed without the use of Confidential Information and without the participation of individuals who have had access to it, or (e) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as otherwise required by law, or as necessary to establish the rights of either party under these Terms and as disclosed after prior notice to TenderTree adequate to afford TenderTree the opportunity to object to the disclosure.
<h2>Content Submitted to the Site</h2>
<p></p>
TenderTree does not claim ownership of the Content that you place on the website and shall have no obligation of any kind with respect to such Content. Unless otherwise stated herein, any Content that you provide in connection with this website shall be deemed to be provided on a non-confidential basis. TenderTree shall be free to use or disseminate such Content on an unrestricted basis for any purpose, and you grant TenderTree an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, transmit, display, perform, adapt, resell and publish such Content (including in digital form). You represent and warrant that you have proper authorization for the worldwide transfer and processing among TenderTree, its affiliates, and third-party providers of any information that you may provide on the Site.
<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p></p>
You agree to indemnify and hold TenderTree and its subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, agents, licensors, suppliers, alliance members, other partners, employees, and representatives harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your Content, your use of or connection to the Site (including any use by you on behalf of another party), your violation of the Terms, or your violation of any rights of another.
<h2>General Terms</h2>
<p></p>
The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and TenderTree relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms. You must not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use TenderTree or third-party products or services.
<p></p>
You agree that any material breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to TenderTree for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, TenderTree will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if TenderTree seeks such an injunction.
<p></p>
Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.
<h2>Terms of Transacting Business</h2>
You understand and are willing to pay forth all costs associated with transacting caregiving business through TenderTree. These costs include but are not limited to the hourly rate as listed on a caregiver’s profile on the Site.
<h2>Third Party Verification Services</h2>
<p></p>
TenderTree may make available one or more third party verification services that enable users of the Site to inquire about information including, but not limited to, another user’s identity and criminal history. Use of a third party verification service is voluntary for both the party requesting the verification and the party undergoing the verification. You agree that TenderTree shall not be held responsible or liable in any way if any information provided by a third party verification service is inaccurate. When a third party verification service is used, you warrant that you will comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681.
<h2>Advertisements and Promotions</h2>
<p></p>
TenderTree may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Site. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers other than TenderTree found on or through the Site, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such advertiser. TenderTree is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such non-TenderTree advertisers on the Site.
Content Provided Via Links
<p></p>
You may find links to other websites or resources on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that TenderTree is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. TenderTree will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any actual or alleged damage or loss caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource.
